Load the __BAP__ package into the global environment with `library()`.
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(
  library("BAP")
)
```

The ISD table is contained within the __BAP__ package. Use `data()` to load the ISD table (`isd.df`) into the global environment.
```{r}
data("isd.df")
```

Import your data. In this case, I will use an example data set provided by E. Mosher that is also contained within the __BAP__ package.
```{r}
data("bap.df")
```

Use `data_prep()` to put your data in the proper format.
```{r}
bap.df <- data_prep(bap.df)
```

Use `calc.isd()` to produce a table calculated ISD values for each ISD model. __WARNING:__ I do not think this has been thoroughly vetted. Please spend sometime checking the output. A good place to start is to compare to output calculated previously in excel or some other platform
```{r}
final.df <- calc.isd(bap.df, isd.df)
```
